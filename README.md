# Getting-started-with-CMSSW
Documenting my setup to run analysis code.

See https://uscms.org/uscms_at_work/physics/computing/getstarted/index.shtml for basic information on accounts and logging in to cms-lpc nodes.  Basic information about CERN lxplus accounts and logins is found in the Workbook https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBook.

At the LPC, first need to source the CMS setup (not needed on lxplus).  
'''
source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmsset_default.sh
'''
I added this to my .bash_profile.
